How did you approach this challenge?
	My approach to this challenge was with caution. Having not worked on this environment before I was very sckeptical about meeting the deadline and submitting a viable prototype. 
	Having said that, I approached this like I approach everything daunting.. taking it in one step at a time.
	Steps:
	1. The first thing I did was look up for resources online to help guide with me ruby on rails. I was blessed with abundant resources on the internet. 
		1.a. I used YouTube to help set up the environment and build a standard app

		1.b. This was then followed by getting a picture of what I need to and how.
		1.c. StackOverFlow for all the errors, and GitHub for code snippets
	2. Once I had my page layout in mind. I focused on the flow. (main, new and edit pages for the clock in event)


What schema design did you choose and why?
	I wanted the app to do 3 things 
	1. Take 2 inputs
	2. Be editable 
	3. Store the values

	Based on that idea I did my research and tried to build the application. 

If you were given another day to work on this, how would you spend it? What if you were given a month?
